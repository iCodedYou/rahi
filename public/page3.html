            <p class="fade-in-delayed">Dear Rahi,
            <br>I honestly don't even know where to begin. I don't even know if you're getting tired of these long ass letters because I feel like I'm just rambling
            <br>on and on about you every time lol. I meant it when I said I could go on and on about you; I try my best to pay attention to everything about you
            <br>(bc i'm obsessed duh), from our first time speaking, to the first time I saw you in person and you literally took my breath away, to seeing you
            <br>glaring at me, drenched after the roaring rapids, to watching Aladdin with you recently (and omfg you were so cute during that movie). I am 
            <br>being as honest as possible when I say you literally deserve everything this world has to offer and more. I really wouldn't think twice about
            <br>supporting you in anything, spoiling you, taking care of you, I don't know literaly anything. I want to be there for your accomplishments and 
            <br>your hardships. I want to get to know you even more, I want to see you even more, I dream of staying up late together cuddling and watching cute
            <br>movies in cute matching hello kitty fits. I never once in my life thought that someone like me with my past would ever be able to have someone as
            <br>wonderful and amazing and beautiful as you, because there is quite literally nobody else like that out there. I want you in my life, and I want to 
            <br>be in your life. I want to see you smile, I want to be the one to make you smile, I want to hear your laugh and your voice every day and every waking moment. 
            <br>You  came back into my life and took me by storm, yet again, but this time I'm not letting you go. From the moment I laid eyes on you I knew you were the girl
            <br>of my dreams. Every day with you is a gift, and every night is a dream come true. I can't imagine anyone else I would rather have by my side to look forward to 
            <br>a lifetime of adventures, laughter, and shared dreams with. There are so many things I want to tell you, so many emotions I wish to convey but the words haven't 
            <br>been invented yet. With every letter and every breath, I hope I can capture at least a fraction of how I feel about you. You're breathtaking, stunning, elegant,
            <br>resolute, and regardless of everything in your life, I hope you never let anyone change that about you.
            <br>From ur #1 fan & bitch,<br>Stoopy Poopy Varuny :)
