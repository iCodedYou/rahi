                <h2>Before I start...</h2>
                <p>I just wanted to begin by saying Rahi I am hopelessly infatuated with
                <br>every part of you. I am completely 100% obsessed with you and at this
                <br>point I don't even know what to do with myself. You are intelligent,
                <br>sweet, caring, kind, precious, pure, independent, passionate, expressive,
                <br>principled, supportive, adorable, strong, resillient, and absolutely drop
                <br>dead super-model-like gorgeous and stunning and beautiful and 
                <br>jaw-dropping hot. I could literally keep going until I run out of words. So, 
                <br>I'm sure you look as ravishing as always, so I wanted to start with a
                <br>moment of admiration to obsess over these pics (I already did when
                <br>making this hehehe).
                <br>
                <br>But yea I'm saur obsessed with you (pls help) and I like u a lot a lot. <3</p>
